# Image-Compression-and-Denoising-using-CNN
This project used Deep CNN based Auto-Encoders for image compression and de-noising 

## Auto-Encoders
* An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning for neural networks that learns efficient data representations (encoding) by training the network to ignore signal "noise". 
* Autoencoders can be used for image denoising, image compression and in some cases, even generation of image data.

## Flow of Auto-Encoder
Noisy Image -> Encoder -> Compressed Representation -> Decoder -> Reconstruct Clear Image

## Dataset: 
* MNIST
